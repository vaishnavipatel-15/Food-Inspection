This BI project involves the following key stages:
1. **Data Analysis:** Understanding the properties of the food inspection data.
2. **Data Preparation:** Analyzing the data using Alteryx and Python, and documenting the analysis.
3. **Data Mapping:** Creating a mapping document to define how data will be transformed and loaded.
4. **Data Staging:** Cleaning the data and loading it into a staging area.
5. **Data Integration:** Loading the cleaned data into an integration schema.
6. **Reporting:** Generating reports based on the integrated data using Power BI and Tableau.
